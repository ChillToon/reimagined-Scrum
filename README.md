"How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?"

By creating a "user stories log" I'm able to see what users of my product wish to see in a future product (for example like a sequel to the current product), or in a potential update to the product (depending on the kind of product it is, like an app, for instance.)

"How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Depending if I'm on a team or if I'm solo-developing, I look towards Scrum and Agile practices. In the event that I'm on a team, I look towards Scrum to help me take on the project at hand with my fellow dev team members; some examples would be Sprint Backlogs to see what we're going to be working on in the future and currently, and Scrum meetings to talk with the team about our movement going forward with development. Whereas if I'm solo-developing, I'd look towards Agile practices by seeing the needs of my client/clients as well as how big my workload is and how I'll be able to manage it throughout development.

"What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?"

A good team member to me means knowing what the best interest is for your team. For instance, if you see a fellow team mate struggling with something on the product and/or a deadline is approaching and you need to pull an all night with the team, you do just that. Being able to benefit the team as much as possible and as efficient as possible is a good team member, in my eyes.
